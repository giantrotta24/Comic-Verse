                <h1><i>He knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, but he doesn’t care.</i></h1>
                <p>While not explicitly stated in the comic books or any other source material, it has been hinted at
                    for years that The Joker actually knows that Batman is Bruce Wayne. For example, The Joker has a
                    habit of targeting anyone close to Batman as well as anyone close to Bruce. He’s even cut off
                    Alfred’s (Bruce Wayne’s butler) hand once! Many fans speculate that The Joker sees Bruce Wayne as a
                    mask for Batman (as opposed to the other way around), and would simply be bored to death if either
                    persona were ever harmed.</p>

                <p>After deducing Batman's secret identity and invading the sanctity of Wayne Manor and the Batcave,
                    Bane not only defeated Batman, but broke his back, leaving him crippled and wheelchair-bound.
                    Helpless, Bruce Wayne left his costume and crime-fighting duties to Jean Paul Valley and set out on
                    an arduous quest to regain his strength and will to fight. Eventually, after much rehabilitation and
                    training with the beautiful but deadly Lady Shiva, Wayne returned to Gotham to reclaim the mantle of
                    the Dark Knight.</p>

Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.",

By the age of nine, Drake had deduced the identities of Batman and Robin as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson after witnessing a gymnastic move by Robin that he previously saw Grayson display in the Flying Graysons. Inspired by the heroes' exploits, Tim trained himself in martial arts, acrobatics, detective skills, and scholastics to better himself both physically and intellectually. When Tim reached the age of thirteen, he saw that Batman had grown reckless and violent following the second Robin (Jason Todd)'s murder by the Joker. After his mother's death and his father's paralysis, Drake decided to intervene and Batman eventually enlisted him as the third Robin.",

        earlyLife: "General Dru-Zod had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet Krypton. The bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun, but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation. This was the reason why Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for 25 Krypton sun-cycles. Some 12 years later, totally oblivious to these facts, a scientist on the Earth is demonstrating his newly invented 'duplicating ray' to Superboy, and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero. The copy, quickly labeled ;'Bizarro', is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Superboy is eventually forced to 'kill' the clone, using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like blue kryptonite (as opposed to green kryptonite, Superboy's weakness) on the copy. Years afterward, Superman's arch-foe Lex Luthor recreates the 'duplicating ray' and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate. The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating: 'Me not human... me not creature... me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't belong in world of living people! Me don't know difference between right and wrong — good and evil!' Luthor is arrested by Bizarro for re-creating him, but forgotten as Bizarro attempts to emulate Superman, creating havoc in the city of Metropolis and almost exposing Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent.", 
        currentHistory: "When Bizarro falls in love with reporter Lois Lane, she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a 'Bizarro Lois', who is instantly attracted to Bizarro. The Bizarros leave Earth together, determined to find a home where they can be themselves.",

Surviving discrimination and hardship during the Nazi rise to power, the passing of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and Kristallnacht, Max and his family fled to Poland where they were captured during the German invasion of Poland and sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Magneto's experiences surviving Nazi Germany, Auschwitz, and Vinnytsia would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the Marvel Universe. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants ('Homo superior') will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.",
