# Comic Verse

### Application Concept:
Comic Verse is a full stack website designed to be your one stop destination for all comic book character information. 

***
### Developers: 
#### Front-End
* [Andrew Aramouni](https://github.com/ShampooPencil)
* [Zach Heimann](https://github.com/zrh231)
#### Back-End
* [Tyler McKellar](https://github.com/MistaWizard)
* [Gian Trotta](https://github.com/giantrotta24)

## Future Development
* The original concept for Comic Verse included a turn based game where you could select any character within our database as a selectable playable option. The overall design for the website and functionality between front and back end made the game functionality fall into our ice box. This is still a feature we would love to add to our full-stack website. 
* More accessible admin character authorization and a better way to identify between an admin and a regular user. 
* An edit profile option for more user profile customization.
