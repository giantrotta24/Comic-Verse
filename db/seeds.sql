The bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun, but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation. This was the reason why Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for 25 Krypton sun-cycles. Some 12 years later, totally oblivious to these facts, a scientist on the Earth is demonstrating his newly invented 'duplicating ray' to Superboy, and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero. The copy, quickly labeled ;'Bizarro', is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Superboy is eventually forced to 'kill' the clone, using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like blue kryptonite (as opposed to green kryptonite, Superboy's weakness) on the copy. Years afterward, Superman's arch-foe Lex Luthor recreates the 'duplicating ray' and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate. The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating: 'Me not human... me not creature... me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't belong in world of living people!

His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Magneto's experiences surviving Nazi Germany, Auschwitz, and Vinnytsia would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the Marvel Universe. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants.
